# Free-Shopping-List-APP
This is a free Google app you can create to manage your shopping lists effortlessly. Most of us have multiple shopping lists for different stores, and after trying several other apps, I decided to build one myself.

Unlike other apps, this one allows you to set up separate lists for each store you shop from. It also keeps track of your popular items and suggests them the next time you create a list, making the process faster and more convenient. When you check off an item, it disappears from your current list automatically.

The only requirement is a Google account. In this guide, Iâ€™ll show you how to build this app for yourself and take control of your shopping experience!

Step 1: Set Up Your Google Sheet
Log in to your Google account and open Google Sheets.
Create a new Google Sheet and name it "Shopping List":
Click on the title at the top-left corner and type "Shopping List."
At the bottom of the sheet, where tabs are located, rename the default tab ("Sheet 1") to "Shopping List":
Right-click on the "Sheet 1" tab.
Select "Rename" and type "Shopping List".
